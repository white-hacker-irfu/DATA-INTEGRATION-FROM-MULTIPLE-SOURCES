## Task 2: Enhancing Customer Loyalty and Sales Performance Report

In Task 2, we focused on enhancing the **Customer Loyalty and Sales Performance Report** by refining data visualization, integrating filters, and improving user interactivity. The key objective was to ensure that the report effectively conveys insights regarding sales distribution and customer loyalty segmentation while enabling users to interact with and analyze data dynamically.

**Data Preparation and Relationship Setup**
We began by ensuring that the dataset was well-structured and relationships between tables were correctly defined. The primary dataset included **Order ID, Product, Sales Amount, Customer Name, and Loyalty Status**. To facilitate advanced filtering and better insights, we linked the **Sales_Data** table with the **Customer_Data** table using the **Customer ID** field. During this process, we encountered an issue where Power BI indicated an existing relationship between these tables. Upon verification, we confirmed that the relationship was automatically created and functioning as expected.

**Creating the Visualizations**
We designed multiple visualizations to effectively present sales and customer loyalty insights:
1. **Sales Transactions Table:** A tabular view displaying **Order ID, Product, Sales Amount, Customer Name, and Loyalty Status** to provide a detailed breakdown of each transaction.
2. **Loyalty Status and Sales Amount Visual:** A scatter plot visualizing the correlation between different **Loyalty Status levels** and **Sales Amounts**, allowing users to identify spending trends across loyalty tiers.
3. **Sales Summary Table:** A table summarizing total sales by **Customer Name**, offering a clear overview of each customerâ€™s purchase contribution.

These visualizations helped in understanding customer behavior, identifying high-value customers, and determining the impact of loyalty status on sales performance.

**Adding the Loyalty Status Slicer**
To make the report more interactive, we introduced a **Dropdown Slicer for Loyalty Status**. This slicer allows users to filter data based on different loyalty categories (Gold, Platinum, and Silver). The implementation steps were:
1. **Selecting the Slicer Visual:** From the **Visualizations Pane**, we chose the **Slicer** visual.
2. **Adding the Loyalty Status Field:** We dragged the **Loyalty Status** field into the slicer.
3. **Formatting as Dropdown:** To ensure a compact and user-friendly design, we changed the slicer style to a dropdown format.
4. **Testing the Functionality:** We verified that selecting different loyalty statuses dynamically filters the sales data and updates visualizations accordingly.

**Customization and Aesthetic Improvements**
We refined the **dashboard layout and color scheme** to enhance readability and professional appeal. A **gradient background** was added to create a visually engaging interface. Text formatting was adjusted to ensure **headings and labels were clear**. Spacing and alignment were optimized to provide a structured and uncluttered dashboard.

**Final Review and Enhancements**
After implementing the slicer and refining the visuals, we conducted a **final review** to ensure seamless functionality. Key improvements included:
- Ensuring **data synchronization** across all visuals.
- Adjusting **filter interactions** to prevent inconsistencies.
- Verifying that slicer selections update all **dependent visuals dynamically**.

**Conclusion**
With these enhancements, the **Customer Loyalty and Sales Performance Report** now provides a **clear, interactive, and insightful** representation of sales data. The integration of **filters, refined visualizations, and interactive elements** ensures that users can easily analyze and interpret sales trends based on customer loyalty. This structured and dynamic approach significantly improves decision-making capabilities for businesses looking to leverage customer loyalty insights for strategic planning.
